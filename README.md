A web project built using Tailwind CSS and standard web technologies.

## Project Overview

This repository contains a web project initialized with HTML, CSS, and Tailwind CSS for styling. It includes configuration files for package management and PostCSS setup.

## Features

* Responsive design using Tailwind CSS
* Simple and clean code structure
* Easy to extend and customize

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your system before running the project:

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14 or higher recommended)
* npm (comes with Node.js)

## Environment Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/utk1725/utk1725.git
cd utk1725
```

2. **Install dependencies:**

```bash
npm install
```

3. **Run the development server:**

Depending on your setup, this project likely uses a tool like `live-server` or `vite` to serve the files. If not specified, you can use any static server.

If you have `live-server` installed globally, run:

```bash
live-server
```

Or, if using npm scripts, check `package.json` for a `start` script:

```bash
npm run start
```

4. **Open your browser and visit:**

```
http://localhost:3000
```

(or the port specified by your dev server)

## Build

If your project requires building CSS with Tailwind and PostCSS, run:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will generate the final CSS based on your Tailwind configuration.
